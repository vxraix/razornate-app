# 📦 Install Node.js First

Node.js is required to run this application. Follow these steps:

## Option 1: Download from Official Website (Recommended)

1. **Go to**: https://nodejs.org/
2. **Download** the LTS version (Long Term Support)
3. **Run the installer** and follow the setup wizard
4. **Make sure** to check "Add to PATH" during installation
5. **Restart** your terminal/PowerShell after installation

## Option 2: Using Chocolatey (If you have it)

```powershell
choco install nodejs-lts
```

## Verify Installation

After installing, open a **NEW** terminal/PowerShell and run:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

You should see version numbers (e.g., v20.x.x and 10.x.x)

## Then Come Back

Once Node.js is installed, we can continue with:
1. Installing dependencies
2. Setting up the database
3. Running the app
